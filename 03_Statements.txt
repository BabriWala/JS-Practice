A computer program is a list of "instructions" to be "executed" by a computer.
In a programming language, these programming instructions are called statements.
A JavaScript program is a list of programming statements.

In HTML, JavaScript programs are executed by the web browser.

JavaScript statements are composed of:
Values, Operators, Expressions, Keywords, and Comments.

Most JavaScript programs contain many JavaScript statements.
The statements are executed, one by one, in the same order as they are written.
JavaScript programs (and JavaScript statements) are often called JavaScript code.

Semicolons separate JavaScript statements.
Add a semicolon at the end of each executable statement: 

JavaScript ignores multiple spaces. You can add white space to your script to make it more readable.

The following lines are equivalent:

A good practice is to put spaces around operators ( = + - * / ):

JavaScript Line Length and Line Breaks

For best readability, programmers often like to avoid code lines longer than 80 characters.

If a JavaScript statement does not fit on one line, the best place to break it is after an operator:

JavaScript statements can be grouped together in code blocks, inside curly brackets {...}.

The purpose of code blocks is to define statements to be executed together.

One place you will find statements grouped together in blocks, is in JavaScript function

JavaScript statements often start with a keyword to identify the JavaScript action to be performed.

Our Reserved Words Reference lists all JavaScript keywords.

Here is a list of some of the keywords you will learn about in this tutorial: 

JavaScript keywords are reserved words. Reserved words cannot be used as names for variables.
